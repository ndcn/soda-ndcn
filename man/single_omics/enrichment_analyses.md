## Enrichment analyses: Geneset enrichment & Overrepresentation analysis

Only available for Proteomics, Transcriptomics and Genomics

### Setup:

In the data upload tab, additional representations can be produced in the  Geneset enrichment and Over representation analysis box. It is divided in three parts: Data preparation, Geneset enrichment analysis and Over representation analysis. The data preparation section sets some parameters to select the features that will be used either in geneset enrichment or over representation analysis. It essentially consists in the table selection, a selection of two groups to compare for the subsequent analyses, the statistical test to use in order to select the relevant features, mean or median for the group value calculations, the p-value adjustment method and the p-value cut-off. It is important to keep in mind that subsequent GSEA and ORA results are directly dependent on the settings in the data preparation section, especially the selected groups. The Geneset enrichment section displays several widgets: the GO ontologies to use (All, BP, MF, CC), the p-value adjustment to use, max and min geneset size, the number of categories to retrieve, the p-value cutoff and the Run GSEA button to start GSEA analysis. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method used to determine whether a predefined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two sample groups. Instead of focusing on individual genes, GSEA evaluates the collective behavior of groups of genes that share common biological functions, pathways, or other categorizations. By doing so, it can identify subtle but coordinated changes in the expression of functionally related genes, which might be overlooked when analyzing genes individually. This approach provides a more holistic view of the underlying biological processes that might be altered in the studied conditions, helping gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms at play. The Overrepresentation analysis section presents similar widgets, but with FC (fold change) cutoff an q-value cutoff. For more information about these parameters, we recommend consulting [URL]. Over Representation Analysis (ORA) is a method used to identify whether a predefined set of genes, often associated with a particular biological function or pathway, is represented more than expected by chance within a given list of genes of interest (e.g., genes upregulated in a disease state). In ORA, one starts with a list of genes that are deemed significant based on some criteria (like differential expression represented by the fold change) and then checks if any predefined gene sets are overrepresented in this list. The significance of the overrepresentation is typically assessed using statistical methods like the hypergeometric test. Unlike methods that consider all genes in an experiment, ORA focuses only on the genes that meet the initial significance criteria. This approach helps in pinpointing specific biological processes or pathways that might be enriched in the context of the studied condition.

### Visualization:
Both GSEA and ORA display similar plots, with ORA focus on the over-expressed features. Setup and additional information for these can be found in the Data upload section. Some notions might be useful to understand these analyses, which group genes into functions or pathways. Gene count: total number of genes found in the dataset relating to the given function. Gene ratio: gene count divided by the total amount of genes involved in that function.  
- **Dot plot.** Graphical representation used to visualize the enrichment results of multiple gene sets across different conditions or treatments. Each dot on the plot represents a specific gene set. The position of the dot along the x-axis indicates the gene ratio while the y-axis represents the individual gene sets or pathways. The size of the dot is be used to convey the gene count and the color represents the significance level (e.g., p-value). By presenting the data in this manner, dot plots provide a concise and intuitive overview of the enrichment results, allowing to quickly identify and compare the most relevant biological processes or pathways across different experimental conditions.  
- **Bar plot.** TBD
- **Ridge plot.** This visualization offers a multi-layered representation of GSEA data. Each "ridge" or layer corresponds to a specific gene set, showcasing its gene count distribution against the log2 fold change through a density plot. These ridges are systematically stacked for easy vertical comparison, enabling a clear juxtaposition of gene count distributions across various gene sets. The color gradient, determined by their p-values, further enhances the interpretability of the data. The ridge plot's design facilitates swift pattern recognition, pinpointing of gene sets with unique enrichment profiles, and comparison of gene set behaviors across diverse experimental contexts. Its compact and stratified presentation ensures a thorough overview, simplifying the task of identifying notable trends and outliers in the enrichment outcomes.  
- **CNET plot.** Gene-Concept networks provide a way to visualize and interpret the complex relationships between features and their associated GO terms. These networks are particularly useful for understanding the interconnectedness of genes within and across enriched pathways. Nodes are of two types, representing either features or GO terms. The color of feature nodes represent their differential expression level in the studied conditions (log2 fold change).  Edges between nodes represent known biological relationships or interactions between feature nodes and GO nodes. These interactions help identifying which particular pathways or gene sets are being affected in the observed conditions. The layout of the CNET network is typically designed to cluster features from the same pathway or gene set together, making it easier to identify modules of interacting features that belong to the same biological process. CNET networks can help gaining deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed enrichment patterns. This approach helps in identifying key driver genes, understanding pathway crosstalk, and revealing potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers.  
- **eMap plot.** enrichment Map networks are a visualization tool designed to represent and interpret the results of geneset enrichment analyses in a network format. The primary goal of eMap networks is to provide a holistic view of the enrichment landscape, emphasizing the relationships and overlaps between enriched genesets. Each node represents a geneset or pathway. The size and color of a node can be made proportional to the number of genes in the geneset, gene ratio or p-value derivatives. Edges between nodes indicate overlaps or shared genes between genesets. The thickness or weight of an edge often corresponds to the extent of this overlap: thicker edges indicate a higher number of shared genes between the connected genesets. The default similarity score used is Jaccards score (JC), and edge connections can be modulated via the score threshold slider. The layout of the eMap network is designed to cluster related or overlapping genesets together. This clustering helps in identifying groups of related pathways or processes that might be collectively affected in the studied conditions.

## Single-omics analysis

### Metadata upload:
Tab designed for the upload and curation metadata. Once uploaded, two distinct tables are generated and stored in the omics object:
- Imported metadata table: this is the original table, reserved for reset purposes.
- Raw metadata table: the above table filtered by the user, specifically for processing in later steps.

Within the interface, these tables can be selected using the dropdown menu located adjacent to the *Browse* button. Based on the selection, a table preview along with a data summary will be showcased. For easy access and portability, each table can be saved through the 'Download' button. Interactivity with the Raw Metadata Table is enhanced with the widgets located on the right:
- Select Column: This feature lets users designate columns as outlined in the *Metadata File* section.
- Text Patterns: text matching, handy for automatic identification of blanks, QCs, and pooled samples within the *Sample Type* column.
- Sample Filtering:
	- Blanks, QCs, and Pools can be excluded from analysis. This is the suggested approach unless assessing the experiment's quality.
	- Users can either cherry-pick individual samples or select groups to be excluded. Conversely, specific samples can be retained, leading to the exclusion of all others.
	- Real-time visualization of the filtering effects is available via the summary plots.

### Data upload:  
Tab designed for the upload and curation of data files. Upon uploading, several tables are generated and saved. The primary tables among these are:
- Imported Data Table: This serves as the original table and is intended for reset purposes.
- Raw Data Table: the above table filtered by the user, specifically for processing in later steps.
The Raw Data Table is automatically generated using default filtering criteria, retaining only rows from the Raw Metadata Table. There are various derivative tables stemming from this main table. Users can easily select any of these tables from the dropdown menu adjacent to the *Browse* button, with the option to also download them. Both the table preview and data summary dynamically adjust based on the table chosen. For Lipidomics Experiments Only: as filtering is applied to the Raw Data Table, the data summary plot will dynamically display the class distribution in real time.

- **Raw Data Table Filtering**:
**Imputation.** This is designed to fill missing values. Users have the flexibility to skip this step or apply it either pre or post *Blank & Group filtering*.  
- When activated, it functions on individual groups from the *Group column*, utilizing *Imputation Method* and *Minimum Values* defaults, set at 'Median' and 0.6 (60%) respectively.
- If a particular group has a minimum of 60% non-missing values, the absent values within that group will be substituted with the group's median value.
- Note: Imputation before *Blank & Group filtering* may significantly influence the filtering outcome.  
**Blank & Group Filtering.** Its purpose is to weed out features that don't markedly surpass blank signals. It employs the parameters Blank multiplier, Sample threshold, Group threshold, defaulted at 2, 0.8 (80%) and 0.8 (80%) respectively. This is executed in three phases, batch-wise: 1) blank threshold, 2) filtering on the entire dataset and 3) filtering on specific groups within the dataset. 
1. For every batch, a blank threshold is deduced by multiplying the mean blank values by the set multiplier (default being 2). 
2. Filtering on the entire dataset: for a feature to be retained, a minimum of 80% of samples (sample threshold) should register a signal surpassing this blank threshold. If not, the feature undergoes the next test. 
3. If at least 80% of samples within any group of that batch exceed the blank threshold, the feature is preserved. Otherwise, it is omitted from the Raw Data Table.  
Outcomes can be instantly viewed in the preview plot.  
**Normalize to Column.** Once filtering is concluded, signals have the option to be normalized against a numeric column from the metadata.  
**Manual Filtering.** users can either drop or keep individual features from the data. For Lipidomics Experiments Only: features can be picked based on their class.

### Geneset enrichment & Overrepresentation analysis setup (Proteomics, Transcriptomics, Genomics):

In the data upload tab, additional representations can be produced in the  Geneset enrichment and Over representation analysis box. It is divided in three parts: Data preparation, Geneset enrichment analysis and Over representation analysis. The data preparation section sets some parameters to select the features that will be used either in geneset enrichment or over representation analysis. It essentially consists in the table selection, a selection of two groups to compare for the subsequent analyses, the statistical test to use in order to select the relevant features, mean or median for the group value calculations, the p-value adjustment method and the p-value cut-off. It is important to keep in mind that subsequent GSEA and ORA results are directly dependent on the settings in the data preparation section, especially the selected groups. The Geneset enrichment section displays several widgets: the GO ontologies to use (All, BP, MF, CC), the p-value adjustment to use, max and min geneset size, the number of categories to retrieve, the p-value cutoff and the Run GSEA button to start GSEA analysis. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method used to determine whether a predefined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two sample groups. Instead of focusing on individual genes, GSEA evaluates the collective behavior of groups of genes that share common biological functions, pathways, or other categorizations. By doing so, it can identify subtle but coordinated changes in the expression of functionally related genes, which might be overlooked when analyzing genes individually. This approach provides a more holistic view of the underlying biological processes that might be altered in the studied conditions, helping gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms at play. The Overrepresentation analysis section presents similar widgets, but with FC (fold change) cutoff an q-value cutoff. For more information about these parameters, we recommend consulting [URL]. Over Representation Analysis (ORA) is a method used to identify whether a predefined set of genes, often associated with a particular biological function or pathway, is represented more than expected by chance within a given list of genes of interest (e.g., genes upregulated in a disease state). In ORA, one starts with a list of genes that are deemed significant based on some criteria (like differential expression represented by the fold change) and then checks if any predefined gene sets are overrepresented in this list. The significance of the overrepresentation is typically assessed using statistical methods like the hypergeometric test. Unlike methods that consider all genes in an experiment, ORA focuses only on the genes that meet the initial significance criteria. This approach helps in pinpointing specific biological processes or pathways that might be enriched in the context of the studied condition.

### Visualize data:
Tab designed to visualize the single-omics data. Up to 4 plots can be selected to automatically visualize the data. Each plot can be zoomed-in, zoomed-out, expanded, filtered and interacted with through the side-bar menus to change parameters.  
- **Class distribution (Lipidomics).** provides a comprehensive snapshot of the distribution of lipid classes across different sample groups. Each bar represents a specific sample group, and its height indicates the concentration of a particular lipid class within that group. By comparing the heights of the bars, you can quickly discern the relative abundance of lipid classes between the groups. This visualization is particularly useful for identifying patterns or anomalies in lipid metabolism or composition among the studied groups. For instance, a notably higher bar in one group might suggest an elevated concentration of a specific lipid class, potentially pointing to unique metabolic activities or responses in that group. Conversely, similar bar heights across groups indicate consistent lipid profiles. The class distribution serves as an intuitive tool for both broad overviews and detailed comparisons, enabling users to delve into the intricacies of lipid distributions and their potential implications in the context of the study.
- **Class comparison (Lipidomics).** complementary and similar to the class distribution, it displays additional box plots and independent axes. The box plots help understand the distribution of each datapoint inside each bar, and easily spot outlier samples.
- **Volcano plot.** Used to compare two groups. The plot juxtaposes two crucial pieces of information for each feature: the magnitude of its change (log2 fold change, x-axis) and the statistical significance of that change (-log10 p-value, y-axis). Features on the right will be upregulated in the right-side group compared to the left-side group; and the opposite on the left side. The y-axis emphasizes features with high statistical significance towards the top. The power of the volcano plot lies in its ability to quickly highlight genes or proteins of interest â€“ those that are both highly differentially expressed and statistically significant, i.e. outside of the vertical (absolute fold change > 2) and horizontal (p value < 0.05) boundaries. This allows prioritizing candidates for further investigation. Lipidomics only: additional coloring options for lipid classes and metadata. 
- **Heatmap.** An interactive heatmap with hierarchical clustering and side annotations offers a powerful and intuitive visualization of complex datasets. The heatmap itself provides a color-coded representation of data values, allowing users to quickly discern patterns, variations, and relationships within the data. Hierarchical clustering further enhances this by grouping similar data points or variables together based on their similarity, making it easier to identify clusters or groups of related data. This hierarchical structure can reveal hidden structures and relationships that might not be immediately obvious in a standard heatmap. The side annotations add another layer of context, offering additional information or categorization for each row or column, aiding in the interpretation of the data. The interactive nature of the visualization means users can zoom in on areas of interest, explore specific clusters in detail, and dynamically adjust the view to focus on different aspects of the data. Altogether, this type of representation is invaluable for making sense of large or intricate datasets, facilitating both broad overviews and detailed investigations. Additionally, discriminant analysis can be applied to enhance interpretability of the data. This dimensionality reduction will find the axes that best separate the different groups selected by the user and make the heatmap clusters more discernible. It will also help highlight which variables are the most important in distinguishing between groups.  Lipidomics only: feature metadata (lipid class, carbon countâ€¦) can be mapped on the heatmap too. Discriminant analysis can be applied to display the most discriminant features between the selected groups (also useful with large datasets).
- **PCA.** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely-used technique for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Two plots are made available through PCA: the scores plot and the loadings plot. The scores plot displays the data points in the reduced-dimensional space created by PCA. Each point on the scores plot represents a sample, but instead of being plotted using the original variables, it's plotted using the principal components. The scores plot lets you visualize multivariate data in a 3D, making patterns, clusters, or outliers more evident. The loadings plot shows how each feature contributes to the principal components. Thus, it is possible to see which variables have the most influence on each principal component. Variables that are far from the origin (center of the plot) have a strong influence, while those close to the origin have a weak influence. The angle between vectors in the loadings plot can give insights into the relationships between variables. Vectors that are close or pointing in the same direction indicate variables that are positively correlated, while vectors that are pointing in opposite directions indicate negative correlation. If vectors are orthogonal (at a 90-degree angle), it suggests the variables are uncorrelated. While the scores plot helps visualize the data, the loadings plot helps interpret the principal components in terms of the original variables. This is crucial for understanding the meaning or significance of patterns seen in the scores plot.  
- **Double bond plot (Lipidomics).** This plot offers a complementary view of lipid classes to both the volcano plot and the heatmap. To utilize it, select two groups for comparison and specify the lipid class of interest. The double bonds plot reveals structural information about overregulated lipids. Specifically, it plots the count of double bonds against the count of carbons for a chosen lipid class. Each lipid species is represented as a bubble, with its color indicating the log2 fold change and its size corresponding to the -log10 p-value. This design allows for easy identification of structural patterns in upregulated or downregulated species, providing deeper insights into the lipidomic variations between the selected groups.  

### Geneset enrichment & Overrepresentation analysis visualization (Proteomics, Transcriptomics, Genomics):
Both GSEA and ORA display similar plots, with ORA focus on the over-expressed features. Setup and additional information for these can be found in the Data upload section. Some notions might be useful to understand these analyses, which group genes into functions or pathways. Gene count: total number of genes found in the dataset relating to the given function. Gene ratio: gene count divided by the total amount of genes involved in that function.  
- **Dot plot.** Graphical representation used to visualize the enrichment results of multiple gene sets across different conditions or treatments. Each dot on the plot represents a specific gene set. The position of the dot along the x-axis indicates the gene ratio while the y-axis represents the individual gene sets or pathways. The size of the dot is be used to convey the gene count and the color represents the significance level (e.g., p-value). By presenting the data in this manner, dot plots provide a concise and intuitive overview of the enrichment results, allowing to quickly identify and compare the most relevant biological processes or pathways across different experimental conditions.  
- **Bar plot.** TBD
- **Ridge plot.** This visualization offers a multi-layered representation of GSEA data. Each "ridge" or layer corresponds to a specific gene set, showcasing its gene count distribution against the log2 fold change through a density plot. These ridges are systematically stacked for easy vertical comparison, enabling a clear juxtaposition of gene count distributions across various gene sets. The color gradient, determined by their p-values, further enhances the interpretability of the data. The ridge plot's design facilitates swift pattern recognition, pinpointing of gene sets with unique enrichment profiles, and comparison of gene set behaviors across diverse experimental contexts. Its compact and stratified presentation ensures a thorough overview, simplifying the task of identifying notable trends and outliers in the enrichment outcomes.  
- **CNET plot.** Gene-Concept networks provide a way to visualize and interpret the complex relationships between features and their associated GO terms. These networks are particularly useful for understanding the interconnectedness of genes within and across enriched pathways. Nodes are of two types, representing either features or GO terms. The color of feature nodes represent their differential expression level in the studied conditions (log2 fold change).  Edges between nodes represent known biological relationships or interactions between feature nodes and GO nodes. These interactions help identifying which particular pathways or gene sets are being affected in the observed conditions. The layout of the CNET network is typically designed to cluster features from the same pathway or gene set together, making it easier to identify modules of interacting features that belong to the same biological process. CNET networks can help gaining deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed enrichment patterns. This approach helps in identifying key driver genes, understanding pathway crosstalk, and revealing potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers.  
- **eMap plot.** enrichment Map networks are a visualization tool designed to represent and interpret the results of geneset enrichment analyses in a network format. The primary goal of eMap networks is to provide a holistic view of the enrichment landscape, emphasizing the relationships and overlaps between enriched genesets. Each node represents a geneset or pathway. The size and color of a node can be made proportional to the number of genes in the geneset, gene ratio or p-value derivatives. Edges between nodes indicate overlaps or shared genes between genesets. The thickness or weight of an edge often corresponds to the extent of this overlap: thicker edges indicate a higher number of shared genes between the connected genesets. The default similarity score used is Jaccards score (JC), and edge connections can be modulated via the score threshold slider. The layout of the eMap network is designed to cluster related or overlapping genesets together. This clustering helps in identifying groups of related pathways or processes that might be collectively affected in the studied conditions.

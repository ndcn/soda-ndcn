Data upload
=======================
Once the data is uploaded, you will be prompted to select several columns and supply some text patterns.

## Sample metadata

* Sample IDs :

Column containing the sample IDs shared between all uploaded tables.

* Typ column:

Column containing the different sample types, i.e. whether they are actual samples, blanks, quality control or pool samples.

* Text patterns :

Sample types will be interpreted from the chosen type column using text recognition. For this, text patterns unique to each sample type in the type column must be supplied by the user, respectively for blank, quality control and pool samples. If you are not sure which text pattern to use, explore the preview of your table displayed after having uploaded it.

## Lipidomics data

* Sample IDs :

Column containing the sample IDs shared between all uploaded tables.

* Group column :

Column containing the main studied group for each sample for the lipidomics data. This is a column from the metadata table and is different from the type column : the groups are the main interest, i.e. biological groups, genotypes, cell types etc...

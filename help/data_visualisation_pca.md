Plot to observe correlations between sample groups. Two datasets can be selected from the sidebar, either lipid species (individual compounds) or lipid classes. Data points in the scores plot can be coloured by groups using the "Select metadata column" selector. The loadings plot displays which variables cause the observed clustering. Both scores and loadings tables can be downloaded via their respective download buttons.

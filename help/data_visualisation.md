## Lipidomics
#### Class distribution
Displays the lipid class distribution per *sample group* using the *lipidomics class table* (class concentrations normalised to total lipids). For each lipid class and each group, the concentrations of their samples are summed to have the class concentration per group.  

#### Class comparison
Compares the concentrations of lipid classes between *sample groups* using the *lipidomics class table* (class concentrations normalised to total lipids). Each bar represents the mean concentration for the group, with a boxplot displaying the median and the datapoints for each sample.  

#### Volcano plot
Compares the feature differences between two *sample groups*.  
Are your y-axis values all 0s? That is the result of Benjamini-Hochberg p-value adjustment and means there were almost no good p-values in the comparison.
